# JavaScript KSD Konami Code

---

## The "JavaScript KSD Konami Code" project is part of Wes Bos's "JavaScript30" challenge series. In this particular project, participants learn how to create a fun and interactive Easter egg on a webpage using the Konami code.

The Konami code is a well-known cheat code that originated in video games in the 1980s. It consists of a sequence of button presses that, when entered correctly, unlock hidden features or bonuses in the game.

In this project, participants will learn how to detect when the user enters the Konami code on their keyboard, and how to trigger a series of events in response. They will also learn how to create animations and manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.

Throughout the project, participants will work with various JavaScript events and methods, including keydown(), splice(), and Array.prototype.join(). They will also learn how to create and style elements dynamically using CSS.

By the end of the "JavaScript-ksd-konami-code" project, participants will have a solid understanding of how to create interactive Easter eggs using JavaScript, and will be able to apply this knowledge to their own web projects. They will also have gained experience working with JavaScript events and manipulating the DOM dynamically.
